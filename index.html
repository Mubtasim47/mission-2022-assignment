            <p>I am Mubtasim Fuad studying at Daffodil International University. As a beginner I started my web development journey by getting enrolled in the Programming Hero web development course with Jhankar Mahbub. In last 3 days I've learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Git. By using these tools I'm about to make this site.</p>

                <h3>Develop Without Limits</h3>
                <p>Development is fun! There is no limit as well as no boundaries in learning a new technology stack. But we have to gather a reasonable amount of knowledge so that we can get qualified for a web-developer position. I am optimistic that I could learn enough skill to change my life through the programming hero web development journey.</p>

                <h3>Journey with Programming Hero Community</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this course is to guide a learner from his very beginning journey to the advanced topics. This course includes technologies like HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Tailwind, Javascript, React.js, Firebase, MongoDB, Node.js and so on. Till now I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS design that is useful in making a portfolio site like this one</p>

                <h2 class="left-aligned-text">Done with the <span class="orange-text">Assignment</span></h2>
                <p>Finally I am capable enough to make this beautiful site. Although I haven't done it in the best way it could be but I tried hard to implement the basic knowledge of HTML & CSS that I've learned in the past three modules. In this section I'm adding the part that need to be customized. Until the completion of my previous section, I had no idea what to create here but then I thought to show the task that I've done just before it. That's why I'm adding this section here. In this way, I am probably done with my first assignment in Programming Hero Web Development Course by Jhankar Mahbub Vaiya and I really excited to learn new upcoming stuffs.</p>
